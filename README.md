# TLighthouse - Lighthouse Accesibility Thesis

This is a small program that I created to help me to gather Accessibility report from Google Lighthouseâ„¢ for my Bachelor's Thesis.

## Requirement

Before you can install this program, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) this due to [Lighthouse-CLI]() only support the use of Chrome as the program to run the test.

### Installation

To use this program you just need to follow this steps:

- `fork` this repo or `clone` this repo
- move to the directory where this repo located on you local device, then do `npm install` to download all the dependecies
- `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start initiate the program
- you can then access newly created file on `src` named `urlList.class.js` and add the certain url of websites that you want to do test on.
